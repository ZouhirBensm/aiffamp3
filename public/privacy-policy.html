  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <h2>For Website <a href="/">aiffamp3.com</a></h2>
  <p>At <a href="/">aiffamp3.com</a>, we are committed to protecting your privacy while providing a service to convert AIFF audio files to MP3 format. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your data when you use our website. When you upload an AIFF file via our conversion tool, it is temporarily stored in our server’s "uploads/" directory for processing using FFmpeg. The file is deleted immediately after the conversion process completes and you download the resulting MP3, or if an error occurs during processing. We do not retain your uploaded AIFF files or converted MP3 files beyond this point.</p>
  <p>We collect minimal data to operate the service effectively. Your IP address is logged with a timestamp and file size (e.g., "2025-03-24T12:00:00Z - IP: 192.168.1.1 - File: 10.5 MB") in a server-side file called "request_logs.txt" for security, monitoring, and abuse prevention purposes (e.g., enforcing our rate limit of 10 requests per 15-minute window per IP). This log data is not linked to your identity and is retained only as long as necessary for operational needs, typically no longer than 30 days, after which it is automatically purged. We do not share this data with third parties unless required by law.</p>
  <p>Our server enforces limits, such as a maximum file size of approximately 1.127 GB (10% over 1 GB) and a memory cap of 32 GB for queued files, to ensure fair usage. If these limits are exceeded, your file is deleted immediately without processing. We do not use cookies, trackers, or analytics tools for marketing purposes, and we do not sell your data. For any questions, contact us at privacy@aiffamp3.com.</p>

  <h2>For Chrome Extension: AIFF to MP3 Converter (Convertisseur AIFF à MP3)</h2>
  <p>The AIFF to MP3 Converter Chrome extension allows you to convert AIFF files to MP3 format directly within your browser by interfacing with <a href="/">aiffamp3.com</a>. This Privacy Policy details how the extension handles your data in line with its single purpose. The extension requires the host permission "https://aiffamp3.com/*" to securely upload your AIFF files to our server and retrieve the converted MP3 files via endpoints like "/convert", "/status/:taskId", and "/download/:taskId". This permission is strictly limited to our domain and is essential for the conversion process.</p>
  <p>When you use the extension, it sends your AIFF file to <a href="/">aiffamp3.com</a>, where it is processed as described above. The extension itself does not store your files or collect additional data such as browsing history, cookies, or personal information. Your IP address is logged server-side (as noted above) when the file is uploaded, but the extension does not access or transmit any other data beyond the file and a generated task ID (e.g., a random string like "x7k9p2m4"). The task ID is used only to track conversion progress and facilitate download, and it is discarded after the MP3 is retrieved or if the process fails.</p>
  <p>The extension uses the implied "activeTab" permission (via the "action" field in the manifest) to display its popup interface ("webpage2.html") when you click the icon. No other permissions are requested, ensuring the extension’s scope remains narrow. Files are deleted from our server immediately after download or error, and no copies are retained. We do not integrate with third-party services or track your activities outside the conversion process. By using the extension, you agree to this policy. For support or inquiries, email us at privacy@aiffamp3.com.</p>
