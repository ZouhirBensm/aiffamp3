  <p>At <a href="/">aiffamp3.com</a>, we are committed to protecting your privacy while providing a service to convert
    AIFF audio files to MP3 format. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your data when you
    use our website. When you upload an AIFF file via our conversion tool, it is temporarily stored in our server’s
    "uploads/" directory for processing. The file and its converted formats are deleted immediately after the conversion
    process completes, and you download the resulting MP3 if an error occurs during processing. We do not retain your
    uploaded AIFF files or converted MP3 files beyond this point.</p>

  <p>We collect minimal data to operate the service effectively. Your IP address is logged with a timestamp and file
    size (e.g., "2025-03-24T12:00:00Z - IP: 192.168.1.1 - File: 10.5 MB") in a server-side file for security,
    monitoring, identification and abuse prevention purposes. We keep a trace of the IP in order to identify and block
    malicious users from using our tool after diligent analyses. We also enforce an IP-driven rate limit. This log data
    is not linked to your identity and is retained only as long as necessary for operational needs, typically no longer
    than 30 days, after which it is automatically purged. We do not share this data with third parties unless required
    by law.</p>

  <p>Our server enforces limits, such as a maximum file size and a memory cap, to ensure fair usage. If these limits are
    exceeded, your file is deleted immediately without processing. We do not use cookies, trackers, or analytics tools
    for marketing purposes, and we do not sell your data. For any questions, contact us at <a
      href="mailto:earnanswers@outlook.com">earnanswers@outlook.com</a>.</p>

  </ul>


  <p>The AIFF to MP3 Converter Chrome extension allows you to convert AIFF files to MP3 format directly within your
    browser by interfacing with <a href="/">aiffamp3.com</a>. This Privacy Policy details how the extension handles your
    data in line with its single purpose. The extension requires the host permission "https://aiffamp3.com/*" to
    securely upload your AIFF files to our server and retrieve the converted MP3 files via HTTPS. This permission is
    strictly limited to our domain and is essential for the conversion process.</p>

  <p>When you use the extension, it sends your AIFF file to <a href="/">aiffamp3.com</a>, where it is processed as
    described in the section: <a href="#for-web">Website</a>. The extension does not store your files
    or collect additional data such as browsing history, cookies, or personal information. Your IP address is logged
    server-side (as noted in <a href="#for-web">section</a>) when the file is uploaded, but the extension does not
    access or transmit any other data beyond the file and a generated task ID (e.g., a random string like "x7k9p2m4").
    The task ID is used only to track conversion progress and facilitate download. It is discarded after the MP3 is
    retrieved or if the process fails.</p>

  <p>The extension uses the implied "activeTab" permission (via the "action" field in the manifest) to display its popup
    interface when you click the icon. No other permissions are requested, ensuring the extension’s scope remains
    narrow. Files are deleted from our server immediately after download or error, and no copies are retained. We do not
    integrate with third-party services or track your activities outside the conversion process. By using the extension,
    you agree to this policy. For support or inquiries, email us at <a
      href="mailto:earnanswers@outlook.com">earnanswers@outlook.com</a></p>

  <h3>1. General Privacy Policy Overview</h3>
  
  <p>The Android application "AIFF to MP3 | AIFF à MP3" ("the App") is committed to transparent data practices in full compliance with Google Play requirements. This policy comprehensively discloses all data collection, usage, and sharing practices, including the limited circumstances where user data is processed.</p><p>This privacy policy is permanently accessible through multiple channels to ensure transparency. It is publicly available on the App's Google Play Store listing page, embedded within the App's settings menu, and hosted at our website (<a href="#">aiffamp3.com/privacy-policy</a>). The policy applies exclusively to this App and its related services.</p><p>The App maintains minimal data collection strictly necessary for its core functionality. We temporarily collect operational data such as IP addresses and file sizes for security monitoring, but never collect personal identifiers like names, email addresses, or contact information. All storage permissions requested by the App are used solely for the intended file conversion purpose.</p><p>We expressly confirm this App is not directed at children under 13 years of age. The App contains no child-directed content, does not knowingly process data from children, and complies with all applicable children's privacy regulations including COPPA.</p><p>This policy meets all Google Play Developer Program requirements by specifically addressing each sensitive permission used (storage and internet access), disclosing our limited data collection practices, and being made available both before download and within the App itself. We maintain this policy according to Google's latest guidelines for apps handling user data.</p><p>We reserve the right to update this policy as needed, with material changes being communicated to users. All policy revisions will maintain or strengthen existing privacy protections, never retroactively reducing user privacy. A complete version history of policy changes will be maintained on our website.</p>



  <h3>2. User Data Handling & Compliance</h3>
  
  <p>The AIFF to MP3 Android application adheres to strict data handling practices that comply with Google Play's User Data policy. Our app accesses only the minimum necessary data required for core functionality - specifically audio files selected by users for format conversion. We implement modern cryptographic protections (HTTPS/TLS 1.2+) for all data transmissions between the app and our servers.</p><p>Regarding personal and sensitive data, we confirm the app does not access contacts, location, financial information, or any other sensitive user data beyond the temporary processing of user-selected audio files. The READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE and WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permissions are implemented with runtime requests, ensuring users grant explicit consent before any file access occurs. These permissions are used solely for reading input files and writing converted output files, with no background data collection.</p><p>For third-party components, we utilize Apache Cordova framework. Our implementation does not include any advertising SDKs or analytics packages. The cordova-plugin-http, and XMLHttpRequest method is configured to communicate only with our secure endpoint at <a href="/">aiffamp3.com</a>, with no data sharing to external services. We verify that all third-party code complies with Google Play's data handling requirements.</p>  
  <p>The app includes prominent in-app disclosures that appear when first requesting storage permissions. This disclosure appears immediately before the system permission dialog and requires affirmative user action to proceed.</p><p>We maintain a comprehensive data retention policy where all uploaded files are automatically deleted from our servers immediately upon download completion or after conversion error occurs.</p><p>Operational logs containing IP addresses and timestamps are retained for a maximum of 30 days for security monitoring before automatic deletion. No personal identifiers are stored with these logs.</p><p>For European users, we comply with GDPR requirements by implementing data processing agreements with our hosting providers and ensuring all data transfers occur through secure channels. While we do not process special category data under GDPR, we provide EU users with the same data protection standards as all other users.</p><p>The app does not create user accounts and therefore does not require account deletion functionality. All processed files remain under the user's exclusive control on their device, with no persistent storage of user content on our systems beyond the temporary conversion process.</p><p>We confirm the app does not use and will not implement App Set ID or any other identifiers for advertising purposes. No device identifiers are collected or associated with user files during the conversion process. Any privacy policy documentation is available for upon legitimate request by regulatory authorities while protecting our proprietary systems information.</p>


  <h3>3. Permissions & Sensitive Data Access</h3>
  
  <p>The AIFF to MP3 Android application requests only the minimum permissions necessary for its core file conversion functionality. We implement all sensitive permissions with runtime requests, ensuring users explicitly grant consent before access occurs. The app never requests permissions for undisclosed or secondary purposes, and all permission usage is directly tied to promoted features in our Google Play listing.</p><p>For storage access, we request READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE and WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE (up to Android 10) or MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE (up to Android 11) exclusively to enable users to select AIFF files for conversion and save the resulting MP3 output. These permissions are requested in context when users initiate file operations. The app fully respects user denial of these permissions.</p><p>We confirm the app does not request and will never implement any SMS, Call Log, Location, or Health Connect permissions, as these are irrelevant to our audio conversion functionality. Similarly, we do not use Accessibility APIs, VPN services, or exact alarm permissions, as these would exceed our app's core purpose.</p><p>Regarding the MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission required for Android 11+ devices, we confirm this is used strictly for writing converted MP3 files. The app does not perform broad file scanning or access files unrelated to the conversion process.</p><p>For network operations, the INTERNET permission is required to connect securely to our conversion API at <a href="/">aiffamp3.com</a>. All communications use HTTPS encryption with TLS 1.2+ protocols. We do not use background services or persistent connections that would require additional network-related permissions.</p><p>The app does not access photos/videos through media permissions, instead using standard file picker intents when users select input files. We do not query installed apps (QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES) or use any package visibility permissions, as our functionality doesn't require interaction with other apps.</p><p>We maintain strict compliance with Google Play's Restricted Permissions policy by never circumventing permission systems, never reinstating denied permissions without user action, and never using permission-gated data for undisclosed purposes. All permission usage aligns with the app's core functionality as described in our Google Play listing.</p><p>For enterprise users, we confirm the app does not require special signature-level permissions and contains no device administration features. The app operates with standard user-level permissions only, with no privileged access to system resources or protected APIs.</p><p>Our permission implementation follows all Android best practices.</p>


  <h3>4. Device and Network Usage Compliance</h3>
  
  <p>The AIFF to MP3 Android application strictly adheres to Google Play's Device and Network Abuse policies. Our app is designed to operate within secure boundaries that never interfere with system operations, other applications, or network integrity. The application contains no functionality that would modify, replace, or self-update outside of Google Play's official update mechanism, and all features operate exclusively through the packaged Cordova framework and standard webview components.</p><p>For network operations, the app only establishes secure HTTPS connections to our designated API endpoint at <a href="/">aiffamp3.com</a> for temporary, user-initiated file conversion lifecycle. These connections terminate immediately after file processing completes. We implement no background services, proxy functions, or persistent network connections that could impact device performance or battery life.</p><p>The app fully complies with Android's system optimization requirements by never circumventing power management features, avoiding unnecessary background processes, and releasing system resources immediately after completing conversions. We implement no foreground services as the app's functionality doesn't require ongoing background operations - all file conversions occur during active user sessions with clear progress indicators.</p><p>Regarding security compliance, the app respects all FLAG_SECURE protections in other applications and contains no interpreted code that loads at runtime. The implementation includes no functionality that could facilitate cheating, hacking, or unauthorized access, and prevents webviews from loading untrusted content or unverified URLs. All network usage is directly tied to the core file conversion functionality described in our Google Play listing, with no hidden features or undocumented behaviors.</p>
  
  <h3>5. Transparency & Authentic Representation</h3>
  
  <p>The AIFF to MP3 Android application maintains complete transparency about its functionality and purpose through accurate Google Play listings that precisely match the actual user experience. The app contains no deceptive elements - it imitates no system warnings, makes no false claims about functionality, hides no features, and mimics no other applications or services.</p><p>All app operations occur within clearly defined boundaries - the application makes no changes to device settings outside of its own configuration and never modifies system or browser settings.<p>The app represents its identity truthfully without impersonating other developers, companies, or government entities. All developer information remains accurate and verifiable, with no features that facilitate dishonest behavior or promote misinformation. The focus remains exclusively on technical audio conversion services, completely separate from political content or social issues.</p><p>Our promotional materials and metadata present factual descriptions of the app's conversion capabilities without sensational claims or exaggerated functionality. The app delivers exactly what is promised in its listing, maintaining complete alignment between advertised and actual performance.</p>
  
  
  <h3>6. Technical Compliance Standards</h3>
  
  <p>The AIFF to MP3 Android application meets all of Google Play's technical requirements through modern development practices and regular updates. The app targets the current recommended Android API level and follows all migration guidelines for new Android versions, using only approved APIs for its core functionality.</p><p>Our implementation avoids all restricted APIs and platform security workarounds. The app uses no accessibility services for non-accessibility purposes, intercepts no system-level communications, bypasses no permission systems, and accesses no protected content marked with FLAG_SECURE.</p><p>The technical architecture follows Android best practices for memory management, battery optimization, network efficiency, and data minimization. We actively monitor Google's App Security Improvement Program and promptly address any identified vulnerabilities. Each update undergoes thorough testing to ensure continued compliance with evolving Play Store requirements while maintaining the app's core conversion functionality.</p>
